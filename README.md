## Notes and Reminder
- Since my target is Android only, I removed the other platform folders (ios/, web/, windows/, macos/, linux/) to reduce the repository size.
- Donâ€™t worry! If you need them back, these folders can be easily regenerated at any time by running:
    flutter create .
- Also, keep in mind that auto-generated folders like build/ and .dart_tool/ are not be uploaded to here.
